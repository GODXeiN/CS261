RAG.generate_ra() takes as input a project state (Pandas Series; labelled row of data) which contains the following fields:

    * 'pID'                             - INTEGER representing project ID
    * 'Budget'                          - INTEGER for the total budget allocated for the project (hard metric)
    * 'Overall Deadline'                - INTEGER representing the expected length of the project in days
    * 'Budget Elapsed'                  - FLOAT calculated by (Total Costs to current date) / (Budget)
    * 'Time Elapsed'                    - FLOAT calculated by (Num of days since project began) / (Overall Deadline)
    * 'Proportion Subdeadlines Met'     - FLOAT calculated by 
            (Num of internal deadlines which were complete on-time) / (Num of internal deadlines which have been passed in the development)
    * 'Commits'                         - INTEGER representing number of commits to the Git repository
    * 'Defect Fix Rate'                 - FLOAT calculated by (Num of GitHub bugs marked resolved) / (Num of GitHub Bugs in Total)
    * 'Team Communication'              - FLOAT in [1,5] (soft metric)
    * 'Team Commitment'                 - FLOAT in [1,5] (soft metric)
    * 'Team Morale'                     - FLOAT in [1,5] (soft metric)
    * 'Project Planning'                - FLOAT in [1,5] (soft metric)
    * 'Top-Level Management Support'    - FLOAT in [1,5] (soft metric)
    * 'Average Team Experience'         - FLOAT in [1,5]; the mean of the experience rank for all team members    
    * 'Team Size'                       - INTEGER, the number of project dev. team members

Minimum Required Fields:
    * 'Budget' 
    * 'Overall Deadline'
    * All 5 soft metrics, default value: 3
    * Must include at least one team member, of minimum rank (i.e. 'Team Size' = 1, 'Average Team Experience' = 1.0)
    * All other fields must be set to 0 or 0.0 (depending on type)
